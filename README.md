# Mutsugen

A scaffolding for Node JS projects. Why is it called "Mutsugen"? The name is inspired from the anime "Shura no Toki", which is a story about a legendary martial art style called "Mutsu Enmei-Ryu". So, "Mutso" + "Generator" = "Mutsugen" :)

Mutsugen reflects how I scaffold my nodejs projects. It also includes boilerplate codes such as gulp configuration, .gitignore, eslint configuration and etc.
